# Project Artifacts (GitHub Pages)

This repo hosts exported HTML artifacts and a simple index.

## Deploy
1. Push to a **public** GitHub repository.
2. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set Source = `main` branch, folder = `/ (root)`.
3. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Notes
- Filenames use `kebab-case` (no spaces) so links are clean.
- The artifacts open in a new tab to preserve your portfolio session.
